# 1. PMQ - Process Monitoring for Quality:
Process Monitoring for Quality (PMQ) is a new quality assurance philosophy which is a blend of Process Monitoring (PM) and Quality Control (QC) and based on the usage of 
Big Data and Big Model to improve the manufacturing process and quality. PMQ is developed by a group of researchers in Global R&D faculty of General Motors. 
The objective of this philosophy is using the sensors data from manufacturing process to predict the product quality. 
# 2. Steps of problem-solving strategy in PMQ:

Big data also has impacted engineering and manufacturing and has resulted in better and more efficient manufacturing operations, improved quality, and more personalized products. A less apparent effect is that big data have changed problem solving: the problems we choose to solve, the strategy we seek, and the tools we employ (Abell et al, 2017).
